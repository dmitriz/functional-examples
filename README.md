# Examples with Functional JavaScript

Heavily annotated examples from the awesome videos
<a href="https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-refactoring-imperative-code-to-a-single-composed-expression-using-box">Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript</a>,
see also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/5hfq6n/100_minutes_of_free_functional_programming/">the discussion on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13167149">on Hacker News</a>.

See also the wonderful e-book <a href="https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/">
Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming</a>
by the same author (See also https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide for the updates).


## What makes Prof. Frisby's course and book awesome?
Both course and book amazingly manage to avoid suffering from the two widespread diseases when explaining abstract functional concepts: 

- The first disease is to stay with abstract artifically simplified examples that can be easily manipulated 
directly without the theory, thus failing to illustrate the very benefits of the theory and abstraction. 
The reader not familiar with real world uses of that abstraction is therefore struggling to appreciate its usefulness.

- The second disease is to bring complete nontrivial real world examples relying on all technical details involved,
including those not relevant to the point of the explanation. The reader not familiar with those technical details
can feel distracted if not confused.

Professor Frisby masterfully manages to navigate the reader through convincing real world examples
demonstrating real benefits of the functional abstractions with sharp focus and no distraction by unnecessary details.




## Running Examples
Install the packages with either of
```js
yarn install
npm install
```
then enter the `examples` directory and run the files directly with node
```js
node <file.js>
```
